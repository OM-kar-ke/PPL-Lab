1. In Gimple each variable is declard on different line. Multiple variables get different lines for declarations.
Global variable Z is directly used without declaration.

2.Complex experssions are breaked down into simpler expressions step by step in the order of mathematical conventions. 
Like [c = a * b + 25] is resolved , first multiplication is carried out and its value is stored in a temporary variable. 
Then 25 is added in that value and the result is stored in variable c.
	When a complex equation are to be solved then solve them step by step by breaking them into a single equation and the 
result of such simpler equation should be stored in Temporary variables.

3.Dobles or Floats are represented in the exponential form of 10. Here, 34.5 is represented as 3.45e+1 i.e. 3.45 * (10^1).
when a float/double is assigned to an integer only its integral part is get assigned.

4.Because in [z = z + 1]  this assignment there is an equation which has to be solved.
But in [q=z] we can assign it directly.
